# **Project Objectives**
The main objective of this project is to develop an information system which will streamline the existing call management system within the travel company's in-house call management centre (CMC). 

Currently, the CMC faces issues with call routing and flow control for their inbound and outbound calls. To resolve this issue, this project intends to utilise a 'Profiler Tool' to match customers with CMC 'Relationship Managers' (RMs). By integrating this tool as a 'skill matcher' within the proposed system, customers will be readily matched with a RM who can satisfy their unique needs/interests. 

Additionally, this new system will assist RMs to more effectively tailor the sales process for each customer and improve their sales performance.

# Stakeholders

In the major travel company, there are multiple stakeholders who either participate, or have an interest in the activities of the business. These are:

*  Customer
*  Relationship Manager (RM)
*  Project Developer
*  Profiler
*  Target List (Potential Customers)
*  Call Distributor (Call Management Centre)

## Empathy Map

An empathy map is a design tool that assists in better understanding the motivations of each stakeholder. Through understanding the specific activities and mindset of a stakeholder, we can develop a greater sense of empathy with the stakeholder. The ultimate goal in the creation of an empathy map is to best develop a sense of how a stakeholder will react to change in the business, and as such, conduct business in a manner that aligns with the requirements of as many stakeholders as possible.

### Customer
1. Customers are current users and potential buyers. Customers wish to have an expeditious process when they purchase holiday packages. 
2. Customers hope to be matched with an appropriate RM, so that they can purchase an appropriate holiday package. Customers decide their price range or budget, accommodation, destination, itinerary. Customers know they are successful when they have purchased a holiday package
3. Customers will see advertisements or brochures. Customers will see confirmation from the travel company of the details of their trip. Customers do not see the backend of the process. They are also seeing reviews of various holiday packages
4. Customer dialogue consists of requests, questions and confirmation.
5. Customers browse brochures and advertisements, as well as conduct personal research and purchase holiday packages. 
6. Customers hear referrals and recommendations from their friends/colleagues. They also hear a personal, tailored recommendation from RMs
7. Pains: General travel anxieties, lengthy buying process, out-of-budget prices and being recommended an inadequate holiday package.
8. Gains: Quick buying process, more-than-adequate holiday, affordable prices

### Relationship Manager
1. Relationship managers are the person we want to empathise with. They perform sales of holiday packages.
2. They need to sell packages and provide an appropriate holiday package to the customer. Acquire new buyers as well. Maintain current working relationship with customers. They need to tailor the correct package to each customerâ€™s unique needs. We know that they are successful when they meet/exceed KPIs. 
3. They see the profiler tool matching them with customers, see the customer profile. They see other RMs pitching a package. They would be reading a script?
4. They read off a script to persuade a customer. They recommend different additional options, try to upsell. 
5. Fill out a questionnaire which assesses their skills. Sell holiday packages. Log the call after a sale has been completed. Send off the package details to the customer. 
6. Hear customer needs, hear tips & complaints from colleagues.
