# **01 - Project Objectives**
The main objective of this project is to develop an information system which will streamline the existing call management system within the travel company's in-house call management centre (CMC). 

Currently, the CMC faces issues with call routing and flow control for their inbound and outbound calls. To resolve this issue, this project intends to utilise a 'Profiler Tool' to match customers with CMC 'Relationship Managers' (RMs). By integrating this tool as a 'skill matcher' within the proposed system, customers will be readily matched with a RM who can satisfy their unique needs/interests. 

Additionally, this new system will assist RMs to more effectively tailor the sales process for each customer and improve their sales performance.

# **02 - Stakeholders**

In the major travel company, there are multiple stakeholders who either participate, or have an interest in the activities of the business. These are:

*  Customer
*  Relationship Manager (RM)
*  Project Developer
*  Profiler
*  Target List (Potential Customers)
*  Call Distributor (Call Management Centre)

## Empathy Map

An empathy map is a design tool that assists in better understanding the motivations of each stakeholder. Through understanding the specific activities and mindset of a stakeholder, we can develop a greater sense of empathy with the stakeholder. The ultimate goal in the creation of an empathy map is to best develop a sense of how a stakeholder will react to change in the business, and as such, conduct business in a manner that aligns with the requirements of as many stakeholders as possible.

### Customer
1. Customers are current users and potential buyers. Customers wish to have an expeditious process when they purchase holiday packages. 
2. Customers hope to be matched with an appropriate RM, so that they can purchase an appropriate holiday package. Customers decide their price range or budget, accommodation, destination, itinerary. Customers know they are successful when they have purchased a holiday package
3. Customers will see advertisements or brochures. Customers will see confirmation from the travel company of the details of their trip. Customers do not see the backend of the process. They are also seeing reviews of various holiday packages
4. Customer dialogue consists of requests, questions and confirmation.
5. Customers browse brochures and advertisements, as well as conduct personal research and purchase holiday packages. 
6. Customers hear referrals and recommendations from their friends/colleagues. They also hear a personal, tailored recommendation from RMs
7. Pains: General travel anxieties, lengthy buying process, out-of-budget prices and being recommended an inadequate holiday package.
8. Gains: Quick buying process, more-than-adequate holiday, affordable prices
9. Motivations: Going on a holiday, getting a perceived cheap deal

### Relationship Manager
1. Relationship managers are the person we want to empathise with. They perform sales of holiday packages.
2. They need to sell packages and provide an appropriate holiday package to the customer. Acquire new buyers as well. Maintain current working relationship with customers. They need to tailor the correct package to each customerâ€™s unique needs. We know that they are successful when they meet/exceed KPIs. 
3. They see the profiler tool matching them with customers, see the customer profile. They see other RMs pitching a package. They would be reading a script?
4. They read off a script to persuade a customer. They recommend different additional options, try to upsell. 
5. Fill out a questionnaire which assesses their skills. Sell holiday packages. Log the call after a sale has been completed. Send off the package details to the customer. 
6. Hear customer needs, hear tips & complaints from colleagues.
7. Pains: Under-performing customers, difficult customers, stingy customers, fear of redundancy.
8. Gains: Exceeding sales, promotion, travel discounts, make money. 
9. Motivations: Money, satisfaction of setting up a holiday for a customer

### Project Developer
1. Project developers develop the system/project.
2. Develop a working system using agile principles in a timely manner. Prioritising certain functions, identify stakeholder needs.
3. Project developers see comparable products in the market. Project developers are seeing elicited requirements from stakeholders.
4. They discuss with RMs about their needs. They ask customers what they want. Have scrum meetings, discuss with the team about project details.
5. Project developers are doing activities that are within the scope of their current sprint. These activities would include, but are not limited to: developing, designing and testing
6. Project developers hear complaints about the current system, receive feedback. They would also hear feedback from colleagues. 
7. Pains: Not meeting deadlines, inefficiencies, difficult clients, uninformed stakeholders
8. Gains: Educated stakeholders, exceeding deadlines, working, agile software
9. Motivations: Money, pleasure from developing software

# **03 - Design Thinking**

![](https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/ux-daily/5808b55608af6.jpg)

Design Thinking is a recursive process, wherein businesses attempt to gain a greater sense of empathy with the user. The essence of design-thinking is the recognition and utilization of the customer-centric nature of business. In the understanding, and analysis of the requirements of the business, the team employed design thinking in order to best utilise the customers of the business.

Being a customer service oriented business, we felt it necessary to adopt a design-thinking oriented approach. In adopting this approach, the 5 stages of the design-thinking were immensely important to the completion of the project. In naming these 5 stages, the way in which the stage was undertaken with specific reference to this project will be stated. 

In order, the 5 stages are:

## 1. Empathise

In undergoing the first stage of the design-thinking process, the first stage is empathising with the customer. In doing this, there is no more effective way to gain empathy then through the creation of an empathy map.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/7582/1*I1ffOWdPWQva3dCMQE-TAQ.png)

As seen in the above figure, the empathy map takes an extremely literal approach to 'putting yourself in the customer's shoes'. The empathy map considers the senses of the customer in it's approach, so as to allow for an accurate emulation of the customer as a person, not just as an entity that acts alongside the businesses. This encapsulates an important foundation of design-thinking, to truly understand the customer as a living, breathing person, not just as an entity.

Below is our empathy map for the customer:

### Customer
1. Customers are current users and potential buyers. Customers wish to have an expeditious process when they purchase holiday packages. 
2. Customers hope to be matched with an appropriate RM, so that they can purchase an appropriate holiday package. Customers decide their price range or budget, accommodation, destination, itinerary. Customers know they are successful when they have purchased a holiday package
3. Customers will see advertisements or brochures. Customers will see confirmation from the travel company of the details of their trip. Customers do not see the backend of the process. They are also seeing reviews of various holiday packages
4. Customer dialogue consists of requests, questions and confirmation.
5. Customers browse brochures and advertisements, as well as conduct personal research and purchase holiday packages. 
6. Customers hear referrals and recommendations from their friends/colleagues. They also hear a personal, tailored recommendation from RMs
7. Pains: General travel anxieties, lengthy buying process, out-of-budget prices and being recommended an inadequate holiday package.
8. Gains: Quick buying process, more-than-adequate holiday, affordable prices
9. Motivations: Going on a holiday, getting a perceived cheap deal

## 2. Define

In the definition stage of design-thinking, the goal is to define any identified problems from the empathy map, and rephrase them into solutions. This process actualises a core foundational belief of design-thinking, re-framing problems in a humanistic way, so as to realign our perspective of these problems from a standard business problem, into a human-centric one. This was accomplished through the use of POV statements. The template of a POV statement is as follows. How might we [intended action], for [user], so that [desired effect]. Our POV statements, created from our user stories, are as follows:

## 3. Ideate

The ideation phase is essential in the design-thinking process. This phase is where ideas are generated for the problem. This phase of the process is the most abstract, wherein numerous different approaches can be undertaken. Although this phase wasn't undergone in this project, methods of ideation include:

* Brainstorming
* Worst Possible Idea
* The SCAMPER method (An acronym for 7 different thought provocations)

## 4. Prototype

Prototyping is the creation of inexpensive, scaled down versions of the product. These prototypes are then accepted, improved upon or rejected based on user experiences. During this phase, constraints about the product become more apparent, and problems begin to be abstracted. The prototype phase acts as as somewhat of an extension to the empathy stage, wherein a greater sense of empathy toward the user is generated. A prototype allows us to understand how real users would behave, think, and feel when interacting with the end product. In this project, prototypes were represented as work products. Through the creation of various diagrams, a greater sense of understanding of user issues was developed. Additionally, the scope and intricacies of the system were elaborated upon, highlighting previously unknown aspects of the system. This includes a Class Diagram, Activity Diagram, Collaborative Diagrams and multiple Use Case Diagrams.

## 5. Test

The final stage of design-thinking, is testing, however, it is important to remember the iterative nature of design-thinking. From testing the complete product, we can redefine problems that were incorrectly identified earlier in the design-thinking process. In doing this, we gain further insight into how users feel, and our empathy with them is strengthened. Adjustments are made to the product to solve any newly found problems. In this project, testing was not undertaken



The design-thinking approach cannot be measured as effective, as it is an iterative approach. The nature of design-thinking renders every cycle of the process different. However, in the completion of every cycle, the foundational belief of the design-thinking process is achieved, to gain a greater sense of empathy with the customer.
